# Data Science Specialization - Practical Machine Learning Module

Final project for the Practical Machine Learning module.

The objective of this work is to predict the manner in which people do exercises. We will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants who were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
